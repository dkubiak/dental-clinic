# Bootstrap — creates the S3 bucket + DynamoDB lock table that the dev/prod environment root
# modules use as their remote state backend. Applied once, manually, with local state, before any
# environment's `terraform.tfvars` workflow runs (chicken-and-egg: environments can't use a
# remote backend that doesn't exist yet). Re-applying is safe/idempotent.
#
# This is the one piece of Terraform in this repo intentionally NOT run through the
# terraform.yml GitHub Actions workflow on every PR (Principle VI) — the bucket/table are
# long-lived, account-level infra created once by a human with elevated access, analogous to
# how the GitHub Actions OIDC role itself has to exist before any workflow can assume it.
